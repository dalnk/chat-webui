focusing on the LLaMA/Alpaca/Vicuna/Koala/Dolly model but hopefully expanding to other models soon. Thank you to @geohot for making tinygrad and pytorch for ONNX conversions

Alpaca now runs on android! Vicuna and StableLM soon
Whisper.cpp for voice to text

Ideally supporting Vicuña and StableLM. Theres a working version using webgpu here: https://mlc.ai/web-llm/
