# chat-webui
focusing on the LLaMA/Alpaca/Vicuna/Koala/Dolly model but hopefully expanding to other models soon. Thank you to @geohot for making tinygrad and pytorch for ONNX conversions

Alpaca now runs on android! Vicuna and StableLM soon
Using huggingface chat for this as well
Whisper.cpp for voice to text

Ideally supporting Vicu√±a and StableLM. Theres a working version using webgpu here: https://mlc.ai/web-llm/
