# chat-ui
focusing on the Alpaca/Vicuna/Koala/Dolly model but hopefully expanding to other models soon. Thank you to @geohot for making tinygrad and pytorch for ONNX conversions. Need to use quantized files like q4-ggml-vicuna.bin

Alpaca now runs on android! Vicuna and StableLM work now as well
Using huggingface chat for this as well
Whisper.cpp for voice to text
palm api for cloud

Ideally supporting Vicuña and StableLM. Theres a working version using webgpu here: https://mlc.ai/web-llm/
